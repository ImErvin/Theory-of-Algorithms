### Brute-Force Prime Number Distinguisher
##### Solution by Ervin Mamutov - G00311015

### Task

    Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that uses a brute-force algorithm that takes a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and false otherwise. Call the function decide-prime.

### Problem Breakdown

#### What is a Brute-Force Algorithm?
Brute-Force search, is also sometimes called Exhaustive search, is a very general problem-solving technqiue used in computer science. This algorithm consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidaates for the solutions and checking wether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.**[1]**

#### What is a Prime Number?
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.**[2]** Prime numbers are a basic concept but have great uses in Computing for cryptography for example.

##### Conditions for a Prime Number

1. The number must be a positive integer larger than 1
2. When a prime number is divided by another positive integer, the result will only be a positive integer when the prime number is divided by iteself and the number 1.
