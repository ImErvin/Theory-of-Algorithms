### Theory of Algorithms
##### Solutions by Ervin Mamutov - G00311015

### How to run
To run the solutions I have provided you will need to ensure that you have [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) installed locally. To do this simply click on "Racket" and follow their **Download and Install** process.

Once Racket is installed you can simply clone this repository locally.
```bash
 CD anywhere
 
 git clone https://github.com/ImErvin/Theory-of-Algorithms.git

 CD Theory-of-Algorithms
``` 

Now simply open any of the solutions in DrRacket and run the scripts.

```bash
CD <solution name>
scriptname.rkt
```
If this does not work, racket is not in your path - but don't worry you can always open it in the folder and run it from there.

If you have any issues with running the scripts please contact me on github.

#### Introduction
This repository is used to store my solutions for several tasks for my "Theory of Algorithms" module in college. The aim of this module is to teach me how to compare different models of computation, write computer programs using a selection of programming paradigms, analyse the complexity of an algorithm and identify difficult computational problems in everyday programming.

Each directory in this repo contains my solution to one of the ten problems. In each directory you will find a README explaining my thought process and code provided.
The first three solutions have a developers note explaining the code - the rest I left up to the readme to justify my code.
